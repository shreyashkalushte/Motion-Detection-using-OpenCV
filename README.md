# Motion Detection using OpenCV
This file uses OpenCV extensively to detect any changes in the first frame of the video highlight them using a box. 
Use cv2.VideoCapture(0) to capture video directly from your webcam.
To use a video from your system add its path in line 22 and make sure you add the file extension to the pathname (eg:- mp4, mkv)
